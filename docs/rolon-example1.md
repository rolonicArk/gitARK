This rolon shows the use of a classifier and descriptor which would be copied to individual files when doing a commit.

Links like [this](https://github.com/rolonicArk/gitARK/new/master/docs) would also be used to create classifiers,
allowing fast access to rolons which reference a particular page. The name of the classifier would be link and
the value would be the URL.

Any **bold** text would also be treated as a classifier. The name of the classifier is the bold text, the value is simply true.
